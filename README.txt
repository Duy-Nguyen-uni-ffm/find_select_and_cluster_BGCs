A bioinformatic pipeline for finding biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of classes polyketide, terpene, peptide (including RiPP and NRPS), etc in bacterial DNA metagenomes and analyzing the similarity of detected BGCs with BGCs from database MIBiG. 
With this pipeline, a spectrum of BGCs encoded within bacterial genomes or metagenomes can be established, where gene clusters that are possibly responsible for the production of a chemical substance from the bacteria can be identified, as well as novel, uncharacterized secondary metabolite BGCs can also be discovered. 
More information to e.g. requirements and installation, workflow, etc in folder "info".
